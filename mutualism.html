<h1>Towards a New Theory of Venture Mutualism</h1>
<p>Over the last century and more significantly through the past decade venture capital has become hopelessly infamous. It&rsquo;s become synonymous with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/27/is-venture-capital-worth-the-risk">greed</a>, <a href="https://thiscouldbeourfuture.com/">hubris</a>, and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/17/1003318/why-venture-capital-doesnt-build-the-things-we-really-need">meritless frivolity</a> (it&rsquo;s time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/a16z-chris-dixon-adam-neumann-flow-funding-disrupt-2022/">build</a>). The reality of the situation has gotten so bad that even some of its strongest supporters find it difficult to go without highlighting the <a href="https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale/status/1694332914354229342">predatory behavior</a> that the industry consistently engages in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recognition of the failures of venture especially in the last decade has created <a href="https://medium.com/@trebors/platform-cooperativism-vs-the-sharing-economy-2ea737f1b5ad">entire</a><a href="https://www.noemamag.com/exit-to-community/"> movements</a> dedicated to finding better models that topple the <a href="https://nathanschneider.info/books/everything-for-everyone/">winner-take-all</a> dynamics created by it. In fact, much like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-genesis-block-14th-birthday-reflection">Bitcoin</a> is inextricably tied to the <a href="https://time.com/6117696/occupy-wall-street-10-years-later/">2008 financial crisis</a>, projects like <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale">Ethereum</a> are inextricably tied to this rise in dissatisfaction with the current state of venture.</p>
<p><strong>Why then is Ethereum filled with its own new era of venture investors, and what (if anything) should we actually do about it?</strong></p>
<h2>The Origins of The World Computer</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2014, Ethereum launched a public sale that would spark a reimagining of <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html">internet-native coordination</a>. Projects like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/30f98i/introducing_edollar_the_ultimate_stablecoin_built/">Maker</a> quickly followed suit in some of the first attempts to allow anyone to participate in new forms of public infrastructure &ndash; the first &lsquo;&ETH;apps&rsquo; on top of the Ethereum <a href="https://hir.harvard.edu/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-1/">world computer</a>.</p>
<p>By raising from their own communities, their own publics, Ethereum and early &lsquo;Initial Coin Offerings&rsquo; (ICOs) in 2015-16 showed that we might not actually need to privately raise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/stripe-now-valued-at-50b-following-6-5b-raise/">billions of dollars</a> from a handful of people to build the future we want to see. Instead, by allowing anyone to participate in economic opportunity, we could build a more collaborative ecosystem with a more prosocial message &ndash; a welcome change in an era where the prevailing belief was that all anyone could count on to be socialized were <a href="https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/flaws-financial-system-socializing-risk-privatizing-profit">losses</a>.</p>
<p>While ICOs were filled with their own challenges around <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6c23ua/is_hack_ethercamp_dead/">accountability</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6efqfe/the_current_ico_model_is_broken_what_technical/">distribution</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/69p4my/a_concern_about_longterm_viability_of_ico_tokens/">incentive alignment</a>, the demand to have ownership in decentralized applications on top of a &lsquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LK0t_qaPo&amp;ab_channel=Ethereum">world computer</a>&rsquo; was at all time highs. The energy was electric, and nerds around the world were convening in the same tiny corner of cyberspace at random hours of the night to work on everything from <a href="https://medium.com/@MakerDAO/what-is-mkr-e6915d5ca1b3">global currencies</a> to new forms of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/project/history/">interplanetary storage</a>.</p>
<p>Slowly, the success of these developments led to <a href="https://blog.coinfund.io/coinfund-2016-year-in-review-3a24f8ec43de">venture funds</a> starting to emerge, at first acting largely as <a href="https://www.smithandcrown.com/">ratings agencies</a> that invested the same way as everyone else while combating the rampant fraud in early token offerings. As more of these funds became successful, it opened the gates for other <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/future-trust-crypto-summit-2018/">larger investors</a> from <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">outside the scene</a> to start getting involved. By 2018, after a flood of new entrants, venture-style models were once again<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/there-are-now-more-than-120-hedge-funds-focused-solely-on-bitcoin.html"> mainstream</a>. At the same time that venture poured in, the folly of ICOs soured the public enough on the model to discard it in favor of various forms of <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">progressive</a><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/"> decentralization</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the interest in venture grew, the size of funds grew as well. As sizes grew, so did check sizes. As check sizes grew, so did valuations. As valuations grew, so did pressures for massive multi-billion dollar exits. By the time many projects were ready to engage with the public, what was meant to be an &ldquo;<a href="https://www.noemamag.com/exit-to-community/">exit to community</a>&rdquo; often became a form of &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/papa_raw/status/1696754648378662972">dumping on retail</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The surprising part of this story is not the failure of venture, however, but the solidarity of &ldquo;<a href="https://gavwood.com/web3lt.html">web3</a>&rdquo;. As the bear market came around, projects started to take the treasuries they had accrued and distribute purely non-dilutive forms of capital to newcomers through a wide range of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/community/grants/">grants</a> . This was not a purely selfless act, but in part a realization that by building better tooling and infrastructure for Ethereum<em>,</em> the <em>ecosystem</em> they relied on would benefit, and they would rise with the tides as well. In this way, perhaps counterintuitively, some venture firms unintentionally helped sustain a new <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/23/ethereums-regens-tend-to-ethereums-public-goods/">kind of commons</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the tides wash out again and we enter another &ldquo;<a href="https://fintechmagazine.com/crypto/what-is-a-crypto-winter-and-are-we-in-one">crypto winter</a>&rdquo;, we get to see this take shape once again, and simultaneously reflect on important questions about our commons: What do we want Ethereum to actually be? What are our values? When does capital corrupt rather than add to our sustainability? We believe there are real answers to these questions, and that it is precisely because of the level of interdependence and collaboration in the Ethereum ecosystem that we might be able to actually find better ones than we did in the 20th century. Specifically and controversially, we believe we can reimagine venture capital, build better public infrastructure, and convince those &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1693992134796603477">in the arena</a>&rdquo; to play <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/notes/finite-infinite-games-james-carse">infinite games</a>.</p>
<h2>Using Finite Resources to Play Infinite Games</h2>
<p>Time is a flat circle, so it&rsquo;s worth looking back at how pooling capital to fund new technologies and improve the commons has actually worked throughout history. When the <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo27481022.html">Sumerians</a> (~3000 BCE) built irrigation systems to channel water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to their agricultural lands, it was an effort that benefited public temple and palace lands as much as family-owned and individual lands, and so was jointly funded. The development of devices like the shaduf (a hand-operated device for lifting water), along with methods for seasonal crop rotation to maintain soil fertility, were made open once discovered to improve yields and allow for better commercial trade with other neighboring regions.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674988187">Phoenicia</a> (~1550 BCE), nascent joint-stock companies were used by captains looking to build ships and sails for maritime trade expeditions. As might be expected, these expeditions were notoriously dangerous and had a high chance of failure, which the nature of agreements between captains and investors accounted for. By making their journeys, the Phoenicians established extensive trade networks, agreements with various city-states, and ultimately created a number of advances including an alphabet that would inspire the Greeks, woodworking techniques, and urban planning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/the-cambridge-illustrated-history-of-china/B8415BCABB0218ABC80F4EFEEA9F5B2B#overview">Tang Dynasty</a> (~600) structured guilds (domain-specific cooperatives) were formed to deal in specific kinds of products and achieved economic sustainability by selling to wholesalers and shop owners. Bootstrapped by dues and investment endowments, these guilds contributed to a renaissance across areas including silkweaving, metallurgy, and medicine, while ensuring member well-being.</p>
<p>While it might be tempting to say that much of the progress these soceities achieved was largely thanks to strong hierachies and monarchic forces spread through temples or armies or dynastic social orders, the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56269264">historical record</a> shows this was not the case. Rather, as David Graeber notes although configurations of social organization ebbed and flowed progress often emerged (including during some of the periods mentioned above) through networks of polycentric communities with shared, interdependent livelihoods.</p>
<p><strong>The real connection between all of these examples is that atomized notions of individual extractive profit were superseded by a complex relationship between a </strong><strong><em>community, its resources, </em></strong><strong>and </strong><strong><em>their surplus</em></strong><strong>. By prioritizing the well-being of a broader commons, civilizations across time have found various ways to create and maintain technologies for their collective benefit.</strong></p>
<p>In the 20th century we saw approaches to innovation slowly approach the modern model of venture we&rsquo;re familiar with today. Groups like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/21/2887206/jon-gertner-idea-factory-bell-labs-great-american-age-innovation-book-review">Bell Labs</a> were able to create the transistor, practical solar cells, and the UNIX operating system through a form of subsidized R&amp;D publicly and privately funded by AT&amp;T along with New Deal government grants. On the west coast, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262546263/makers-of-the-microchip/#:~:text=Makers%20of%20the%20Microchip%20is%20a%20fascinating%20study%20of%20the,'silicon'%20in%20Silicon%20Valley.">Fairchild Semiconductors</a> and Xerox Parc leveraged similar approaches to create the integrated circuit, the modern personal computer, ethernet, and unfortunately object-oriented programming. In 1968, Arthur Rock, who supported Fairchild, went on to invest in Gordon Moore at Intel through what was arguably the first modern venture fund.</p>
<p>Why then is there so much disdain for modern venture? Not because of any one firm or investment, but because of the cycles of excess it creates as it seeks to deploy ever-increasing amounts of capital, much like we saw in crypto. As scholars like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Carlota Perez</a> have identified, capital-driven cycles of innovation <em>almost always</em> create increasing instability and fragile bubbles that eventually burst. Worse, as we enter later-stages of these bubbles we start to see an <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/essay/the-theft-of-the-commons">enclosure</a> of public knowledge, an increasing focus on <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/10/yes-short-termism-really-is-a-problem">easy wins</a> rather than long-term gains, and a chilling effect on critical research. It&rsquo;s no surprise then that what started with Arthur Rock ended with <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2020/10/wework-billion-dollar-loser-book-excerpt.html">WeWork</a>.</p>
<h2>A Collective Call to Action</h2>
<p>The good news is that we can learn from history and reform venture through exactly the kind of commons-based self-governance that <a href="https://www.actu-environnement.com/media/pdf/ostrom_1990.pdf">Ostrom</a> won the Nobel prize for in 2009. But we can <em>only achieve this </em>if we set norms and incentives that give us reason to collectively act through our self-interest, as Ethereum&rsquo;s shared currency provides for.</p>
<p>By creating new forms of infrastructure and new economic mechanisms, we can create a new form of venture we might (half in jest) call venture mutualism. Following in the footsteps of activists like <a href="https://p2pfoundation.net/">Michel Bauwens</a> and <a href="https://ssir.org/books/excerpts/entry/hiding_in_plain_sight">Sara Horowitz</a> then, our mission is simple:</p>
<p><strong>Public Works exists to encourage developers to </strong><strong><em>build more open source software, to generate sustainable surplus, and to meaningfully distribute ownership</em></strong><strong>, so that we might finally establish a network of decentralized <em>systems</em> that can genuinely rely on each other.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Critically, the <em>form</em> these networks take matter. Drawing from Vitalik&rsquo;s work on the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/10/28/revenue_evil.html">revenue-evil curve</a>, we recognize that not everything should have a business model. Rather, by establishing new forms of open, generative infrastructure we can cross-subsidize those goods that if monetized would become significantly inaccessible to the broader community.</p>
<p>To construct cross-subsidies and real interdependence, without inadvertently recreating the same problems, we propose that venture should aim to: restrict itself to seeding the absolute minimum capital required, build with projects as <em>key contributors</em> not just passive investors, and most importantly facilitate better forms of community ownership via new approaches to<a href="https://thedefiant.io/fair-launch-is-a-new-way-for-founders-to-express-themselves-gavin-mcdermott-of-ideo-colab"> fair launch</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually formalizing venture mutualism in a way that ensures it avoids the pitfalls of previous models will need to be a collective effort, and this post is an open call to become a part of it. If this resonates with you, please reach out. Together, we can take another step prefiguratively towards better models not just for crypto but for technological progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/desktop-regulatory-state-chapter-six-second-excerpt/2014/12/30">Bauwens</a>, &ldquo;thank you [venture] for doing this because now we can make something better.&rdquo;</p>
